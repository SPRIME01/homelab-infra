# Runbook: Onboarding New Services

This runbook outlines the steps required to safely and consistently onboard a new service into the homelab environment.

## 1. Planning and Design

-   [ ] Define service requirements (resources, dependencies, network access).
-   [ ] Choose deployment strategy (Kubernetes Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.).
-   [ ] Design configuration management (ConfigMaps, Secrets, Helm chart).
-   [ ] Plan data persistence strategy (Persistent Volumes, database).
-   [ ] Determine monitoring needs (metrics, logs, alerts).
-   [ ] Assess security requirements (RBAC, network policies, secrets management).

## 2. Infrastructure Preparation

-   [ ] Create necessary namespaces.
-   [ ] Set up storage (PVs, PVCs, storage classes).
-   [ ] Configure network policies.
-   [ ] Prepare secrets management (Vault, Kubernetes Secrets).

## 3. Deployment

-   [ ] Create Helm chart or Kubernetes manifests.
-   [ ] Test deployment in a staging/dev environment (if applicable).
-   [ ] Deploy to the production Kubernetes cluster.
-   [ ] Verify deployment status (pods running, services accessible).

## 4. Configuration

-   [ ] Apply initial configuration.
-   [ ] Set up ingress/routing if externally accessible.
-   [ ] Configure DNS records if needed.

## 5. Monitoring and Observability Setup

-   [ ] Configure Prometheus scraping for metrics.
-   [ ] Set up log collection (e.g., Loki, OpenTelemetry).
-   [ ] Create Grafana dashboard for key metrics.
-   [ ] Define relevant Prometheus alert rules.
-   [ ] Integrate with notification channels.

## 6. Backup and Recovery Setup

-   [ ] Configure application data backups.
-   [ ] Add configuration to configuration backup system.
-   [ ] Test backup and restore procedures for the new service.

## 7. Documentation

-   [ ] Add service details to the main documentation site.
-   [ ] Document specific operational procedures for the service.
-   [ ] Update architecture diagrams.

## 8. Verification and Handover

-   [ ] Perform end-to-end testing.
-   [ ] Verify monitoring and alerting are functional.
-   [ ] Confirm backup success.
-   [ ] Announce service availability.
