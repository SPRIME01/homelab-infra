# Homelab Implementation Roadmap (CMMN Approach)

This roadmap outlines the implementation of the homelab environment in phases, following principles similar to Case Management Model Notation (CMMN). It allows flexibility for hybrid, agile, or waterfall workflows by focusing on stages, milestones, discretionary tasks, and entry/exit criteria.

**Legend:**

*   **[M]**: Milestone (Significant achievement, often enabling subsequent tasks)
*   **[T]**: Task (Specific action to perform)
*   **[C]**: Checkpoint (Point for testing and validation)
*   **[PC]**: Potential Challenge
*   **[D]**: Dependency
*   **[E]**: Estimated Time (Highly variable based on experience/hardware)
