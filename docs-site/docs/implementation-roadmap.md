**Legend:**

*   **[M]**: Milestone (Significant achievement, often enabling subsequent tasks)
*   **[T]**: Task (Specific action to perform)
*   **[C]**: Checkpoint (Point for testing and validation)
*   **[PC]**: Potential Challenge
*   **[D]**: Dependency
*   **[E]**: Estimated Time (Highly variable based on experience/hardware)
