|   ☐    | Reverse Proxy -> Backend Service (HTTP/HTTPS)           | Access backend service via reverse proxy using its designated hostname/path (both HTTP redirect and direct HTTPS).                               | Service is accessible via reverse proxy over HTTPS with a valid certificate; HTTP requests redirect to HTTPS.                                |
|   ☐    | VPN Client -> Internal Service Access                   | Connect via VPN; access an internal service (e.g., Grafana, host SSH) using its internal IP or DNS name.                                       | Internal services are reachable only via the VPN connection using expected internal addresses.                                                 |
|   ☐    | Prometheus -> Core Service Exporters                    | Check Prometheus UI (`/targets`) for `node_exporter`, `cAdvisor`/`kubelet`, reverse proxy metrics, container platform metrics.                 | All core service metric exporters are showing as `UP` in Prometheus.                                                                           |
|   ☐    | Grafana -> Prometheus Datasource & Basic Dashboard      | View basic dashboards in Grafana (e.g., Node Exporter Full); verify data is displayed without errors.                                          | Grafana successfully queries Prometheus and displays metrics for core infrastructure components.                                               |
|   ☐    | Backup Job -> Backup Repository                         | Manually trigger backup job; check job logs for success; use backup tool commands to list snapshots/files in the repository (`restic snapshots`). | Backup job completes successfully; snapshot/backup data is visible in the repository.                                                          |
|   ☐    | Test Restore from Backup                              | Use backup tool commands to restore a sample file/directory from the repository to a temporary location; compare restored data with original. | Data can be successfully restored from the backup repository and matches the original content.                                                 |
|   ☐    | Authentication Provider -> Reverse Proxy -> Application | Access a test application protected by the auth provider via the reverse proxy; attempt login with test user credentials.                      | Unauthenticated users are redirected to auth provider; successful login grants access to the application.                                      |
|   ☐    | DNS Resolution (Internal/External)                      | Use `nslookup` or `dig` from within a container/VM and from the host to resolve internal hostnames and external domains.                     | Internal hostnames resolve to correct internal IPs; external domains resolve correctly; results are consistent with DNS configuration.         |

|   ☐    | External Network Scan                              | Run `nmap` or online port scanner against public IP address.                                                                                   | Only intended ports (e.g., 80, 443, VPN port) are open; all other ports are closed/filtered.                                                 |
|   ☐    | Internal Network Scan                              | Run `nmap` against internal host IPs from a trusted internal client.                                                                           | Only expected service ports are open on each host; management interfaces are appropriately restricted.                                         |
|   ☐    | Host Firewall Rules Review                         | Manually review `ufw status verbose` or `iptables -L` output.                                                                                  | Firewall rules align with documented security requirements; default deny policy is in place.                                                   |
|   ☐    | SSH Hardening Verification                         | Review `sshd_config`; attempt password/root login (should fail); verify only allowed users/groups can log in.                                  | SSH configuration matches hardening guidelines (key auth only, no root, strong crypto, restricted users).                                      |
|   ☐    | TLS Configuration Check                            | Use `testssl.sh` or SSL Labs against externally exposed HTTPS services.                                                                        | Services achieve a good rating (e.g., A/A+ on SSL Labs); no weak protocols/ciphers enabled; HSTS recommended.                                  |

|   ☐    | Secrets Management Review                          | Check how secrets (API keys, passwords) are stored and injected into services (env vars, Docker secrets, K8s Secrets, Vault).                 | Secrets are not hardcoded in configurations or version control; secure injection method is used.                                               |
|   ☐    | Container Image Vulnerability Scan (If applicable) | Use Trivy or similar scanner on custom-built or critical third-party images.                                                                   | No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities without mitigation plans exist in deployed container images.                                        |
|   ☐    | Default Credentials Changed                        | Verify default passwords/credentials for all deployed services (Grafana, databases, router/switch admin UI) have been changed.                 | No default credentials remain active on any service or hardware device.                                                                        |

| Status | Item                                            | Verification Method                                                                                                                            | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                            |
| :----: | :---------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   ☐    | Baseline Resource Utilization                   | Monitor CPU, RAM, Disk I/O, Network I/O on hosts and key containers/VMs under idle or light load using Prometheus/Grafana.                      | Baseline resource usage is within acceptable limits; no unexpected high utilization at idle.                                                   |
|   ☐    | Network Throughput Test                         | Run `iperf3` between key hosts/VMs across different network segments/VLANs.                                                                    | Network throughput meets expectations based on hardware (e.g., close to 1Gbps/10Gbps).                                                         |
|   ☐    | Storage Performance Test                        | Run basic disk benchmarks (`dd`, `fio`) on host storage and within relevant VMs/containers accessing persistent volumes.                       | Disk read/write speeds and IOPS meet expectations for the underlying hardware and configuration (SSD, HDD, RAID, ZFS).                         |
|   ☐    | Reverse Proxy Latency/Throughput                | Use `wrk` or `ab` to benchmark reverse proxy response time and requests per second for static files or proxying to a simple backend.            | Reverse proxy adds minimal latency and handles expected concurrent connections without significant performance degradation.                    |
|   ☐    | VPN Throughput Test                             | Run `iperf3` between a VPN client and an internal host over the VPN tunnel.                                                                    | VPN throughput is reasonable, considering encryption overhead and link speeds.                                                                 |
|   ☐    | Application Load Test (Key Services, Optional)  | Use `k6`, `locust`, or similar tools to simulate user load against critical applications (e.g., web apps, APIs) and monitor response times/errors. | Application maintains acceptable response times and low error rates under expected peak load; resource usage scales predictably.             |
|   ☐    | AI Model Inference Performance (If applicable)  | Use Triton `perf_analyzer` or custom scripts to measure inference latency and throughput for deployed models under concurrent load.             | Inference performance meets target latency/throughput requirements for the specific use case.                                                  |
