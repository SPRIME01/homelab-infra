# Homelab Testing Strategy (TDD Approach)

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the homelab environment, emphasizing Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles where applicable. The goal is to ensure reliability, security, and performance through iterative development and validation.

## Guiding Principles (TDD in a Homelab Context)

*   **Test First (Where Practical):** For custom scripts, automation logic, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC), write tests *before* writing the implementation code. Define the desired state or behavior, write a test that fails, implement the code to make the test pass, and then refactor.
*   **Configuration Validation:** For pre-built applications (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana), focus on validating the *configuration* rather than the application code itself. Tests should ensure the configuration achieves the desired outcome (e.g., Prometheus scrapes the intended targets).
*   **Infrastructure Testing:** Treat infrastructure configuration (Docker Compose files, Kubernetes manifests, Ansible playbooks) as code and apply testing principles.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Start with basic tests and increase complexity and coverage as the homelab evolves.
*   **Automation:** Automate tests whenever possible to ensure consistency and enable integration into CI/CD workflows.

## 1. Unit Testing

**Focus:** Testing individual, isolated components like custom scripts, functions within scripts, configuration snippets, or IaC modules.

*   **Approach:** Isolate the unit under test, mocking external dependencies (APIs, file systems, other services). Write tests that verify specific inputs produce expected outputs or side effects (like file creation, state changes).
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Scripts (Python):** `pytest`, `unittest`, `mock` library.
    *   **Scripts (Shell):** `shellcheck` (linting), `bats-core` (Bash Automated Testing System).
    *   **Configuration Files (YAML/JSON):** Schema validation tools (`yamale`, `jsonschema`), linters (`yamllint`).
    *   **IaC (Ansible):** `ansible-lint`, `molecule` (for role testing).
    *   **IaC (Terraform):** `terraform validate`, `tflint`, `terratest`.
    *   **IaC (Dockerfiles):** `hadolint`.
*   **Coverage Goals:**
    *   Test core logic paths within scripts (success cases, error handling).
    *   Validate syntax and structure of configuration files.
    *   Ensure IaC code adheres to best practices and generates valid configurations.
    *   Aim for high code coverage (>80%) for critical custom scripts.
*   **Workflow Integration (TDD):**
    1.  Define a requirement for a script/function/configuration.
    2.  Write a unit test asserting this requirement (e.g., `test_function_handles_invalid_input`). This test should initially fail.
    3.  Write the minimal code required to make the test pass.
    4.  Refactor the code for clarity and efficiency while ensuring tests still pass.
    5.  Integrate linters and unit tests into pre-commit hooks or CI pipelines.
*   **Example Test Cases:**
    *   **Python Script:** Test a function that parses a log file line, ensuring it correctly extracts fields and handles malformed lines. Mock file I/O.
    *   **Shell Script:** Use `bats-core` to test a backup script, verifying it creates an archive with the expected name and handles errors if the source directory doesn't exist. Mock `tar` or `rsync` commands if needed.
    *   **Ansible Role:** Use `molecule` to test an Nginx role, verifying the configuration file syntax is correct (`nginx -t`) and the service starts successfully within a test environment (e.g., Docker).
    *   **Docker Compose:** Use `yamllint` to check syntax. Validate required environment variables are defined or have defaults.
*   **Interpreting Results:**
    *   **Pass:** The unit behaves as expected according to the test.
    *   **Fail:** The unit has a bug or doesn't meet the requirement defined by the test. Debug the code, not the test (unless the test itself is flawed).
    *   **Linter Errors:** Indicate potential issues, style violations, or syntax errors. Fix them to improve code quality and prevent future bugs.

## 2. Integration Testing

**Focus:** Testing the interaction and communication between two or more components or subsystems. Verifying that independently developed units work together correctly.

*   **Approach:** Set up a minimal environment containing the components to be tested. Trigger an action in one component and verify the expected outcome or state change in another. Focus on interfaces (APIs, message queues, shared volumes, network protocols).
*   **Tools:**
    *   **API Testing:** `requests` (Python library), `curl`, Postman/Insomnia (manual/automated), `pytest` with API fixtures.
    *   **Container Orchestration:** `docker-compose` (to spin up linked services), Kubernetes test environments (e.g., `kind`, `k3d`).
    *   **Monitoring/Alerting:** Querying Prometheus API, checking Alertmanager API/UI, verifying notification delivery (e.g., checking Discord/email).
    *   **Message Queues:** Client libraries (`pika` for RabbitMQ, `kafka-python`) to publish/consume messages and verify delivery/content.
    *   **Frameworks:** `pytest` can orchestrate integration tests by setting up/tearing down services.
*   **Coverage Goals:**
    *   Test key interaction points between services (e.g., reverse proxy -> backend app, app -> database, Prometheus -> exporter, Alertmanager -> notification channel).
    *   Verify authentication/authorization flows between services (e.g., Nginx + Authelia).
    *   Test data flow through pipelines (e.g., MQTT -> n8n -> Home Assistant).
*   **Workflow Integration:**
    1.  Identify key integration points based on the architecture diagram or implementation plan.
    2.  Define the expected interaction (e.g., "When service A calls API endpoint X on service B with valid data, service B should return status 200 and update its state").
    3.  Write an integration test that sets up services A and B (e.g., using Docker Compose), performs the action, and asserts the expected outcome. This test might initially fail if services aren't correctly configured or implemented.
    4.  Implement/configure the services to make the test pass.
    5.  Run integration tests in a dedicated test environment, potentially as part of a CI/CD pipeline after unit tests pass.
*   **Example Test Cases:**
    *   **Reverse Proxy + Backend:** Deploy Traefik and a simple web app using Docker Compose. Write a test using `requests` to hit the app's domain via Traefik (HTTPS) and assert a 200 OK response and expected content.
    *   **Prometheus + Exporter:** Deploy Prometheus and `node_exporter`. Write a test that queries the Prometheus HTTP API (`/api/v1/targets`) and verifies the `node_exporter` job shows an 'up' state.
    *   **App + Database:** Deploy an application and its PostgreSQL database. Write a test that uses the app's API to create data and then queries the database directly (or via another API endpoint) to verify the data was persisted correctly.
    *   **Alertmanager + Discord:** Trigger a known alert condition in Prometheus (e.g., using `ALERT HighCpu FOR 0m`). Write a test that waits and checks if a notification appears in the configured Discord channel (might require manual inspection or a Discord bot for full automation).
*   **Interpreting Results:**
    *   **Pass:** The integrated components communicate and function together as expected.
    *   **Fail:** Indicates issues at the interface level: network connectivity problems, firewall rules, incorrect API calls/responses, authentication failures, data format mismatches, configuration errors in one or both components.

## 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Focus:** Testing complete user workflows from start to finish, simulating real user interactions across multiple integrated systems.

*   **Approach:** Define critical user journeys or operational workflows. Automate these workflows using browser automation tools or API orchestration scripts. Tests run against a deployed environment that closely resembles production.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Browser Automation:** Selenium, Playwright, Cypress.
    *   **API Orchestration:** `pytest`, custom scripts using `requests` or other client libraries to simulate multi-step API interactions.
    *   **Scenario Definition:** Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) frameworks like `behave` (Python) or Cucumber can help define E2E tests in a user-readable format (Gherkin).
*   **Coverage Goals:**
    *   Test critical user paths (e.g., logging in via SSO and accessing a protected service, submitting data via a web form and verifying it appears in a dashboard).
    *   Validate key automation workflows (e.g., triggering a Home Assistant automation and verifying the expected device state change and notification).
    *   Test backup and recovery procedures end-to-end (simulate data loss and run recovery script).
*   **Workflow Integration:**
    1.  Identify critical end-to-end workflows based on the homelab's purpose.
    2.  Describe the workflow steps and expected outcomes (potentially using Gherkin syntax).
    3.  Write an automated test (e.g., using Playwright or `pytest`) that executes these steps against a staging or production-like environment. This test will likely fail initially.
    4.  Ensure all underlying components and integrations are configured correctly to make the E2E test pass.
    5.  Run E2E tests less frequently than unit/integration tests (e.g., nightly builds, pre-release) due to their complexity and runtime.
*   **Example Test Cases:**
    *   **Accessing Service via VPN:** Connect to WireGuard VPN, use `requests` or browser automation to access an internal-only Grafana instance via its DNS name, log in (if needed), and verify the dashboard loads.
    *   **Home Automation:** Simulate a sensor state change (e.g., via Home Assistant API or MQTT), wait, and then verify (via API/MQTT/UI) that the expected light turned on and a notification was sent.
    *   **Data Processing Pipeline:** Send a message to RabbitMQ, verify an n8n workflow picks it up, transforms it, and inserts data into InfluxDB. Query InfluxDB to confirm the data arrival and correctness.
    *   **User Signup & Access:** Use browser automation to navigate to a service protected by Authelia, go through the signup/login flow (using test credentials), and verify access to the protected resource.
*   **Interpreting Results:**
    *   **Pass:** The complete workflow functions correctly from the user's perspective.
    *   **Fail:** Indicates a breakdown somewhere in the chain of services. Failures can be complex to debug and may stem from issues caught in unit or integration tests, or from unexpected interactions between multiple components. Use logs and integration test results to pinpoint the failure point.

## 4. Performance Testing

**Focus:** Evaluating the responsiveness, stability, and resource utilization of components under load.

*   **Approach:** Use specialized tools to generate synthetic load (concurrent users, API requests, data streams) against specific services or endpoints. Measure key metrics like response time, throughput (requests per second), error rates, and resource consumption (CPU, RAM, network I/O).
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Load Testing:** `k6`, `locust`, `JMeter`.
    *   **Benchmarking:** `wrk`, `ab` (ApacheBench).
    *   **Database Benchmarking:** `pgbench` (PostgreSQL).
    *   **System Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, `htop`, `docker stats` during tests.
*   **Coverage Goals:**
    *   Test performance-critical services (e.g., databases, APIs, reverse proxies, AI inference servers).
    *   Identify bottlenecks under expected or peak load conditions.
    *   Establish baseline performance metrics for future comparisons.
    *   Determine resource limits and scaling requirements.
*   **Workflow Integration:**
    1.  Identify components sensitive to performance or expected to handle significant load.
    2.  Define realistic load scenarios (e.g., number of concurrent users, request rate, data size).
    3.  Write performance test scripts using tools like `k6` or `locust`.
    4.  Establish baseline performance by running tests on a stable system.
    5.  Run performance tests periodically or after significant changes to track regressions or improvements. Monitor system resources during tests.
*   **Example Test Cases:**
    *   **API Load Test:** Use `k6` to simulate 50 concurrent users hitting a specific API endpoint for 5 minutes. Measure average/p95/p99 response times and error rate.
    *   **Database Query Performance:** Use `pgbench` or a custom script to run representative read/write queries against PostgreSQL under load and measure query latency.
    *   **Triton Inference Server Throughput:** Send concurrent inference requests (e.g., using Triton's `perf_analyzer` tool or a custom script) and measure throughput (inferences per second) and latency for a specific model.
    *   **Reverse Proxy Benchmark:** Use `wrk` to benchmark the requests per second Traefik/Nginx can handle for static file serving or proxying to a backend.
*   **Interpreting Results:**
    *   **Response Times/Latency:** Track average, median, and tail latencies (p95, p99). Increases indicate performance degradation.
    *   **Throughput:** Measure requests/operations per second. Decreases indicate lower capacity.
    *   **Error Rates:** High error rates under load indicate instability or resource exhaustion.
    *   **Resource Utilization:** Correlate performance metrics with CPU, RAM, network, and disk I/O on relevant servers/containers to identify bottlenecks.

## 5. Security Testing

**Focus:** Proactively identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in the homelab environment.

*   **Approach:** Combine automated scanning tools with manual checks and adherence to security best practices. Simulate common attack vectors.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Network Scanning:** `nmap` (port scanning, service detection), `masscan`.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** OpenVAS/GVM, Trivy (container images, filesystems), Clair (containers).
    *   **Web Application Scanning:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite (Community Edition).
    *   **Configuration Auditing:** Lynis, `ssh_scan`, custom scripts checking security headers, TLS configurations (`testssl.sh`).
    *   **Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):** Linters integrated into CI/CD often have security rules (e.g., `bandit` for Python, `semgrep`).
*   **Coverage Goals:**
    *   Scan exposed network services for open ports and vulnerabilities.
    *   Scan container images for known CVEs.
    *   Assess web applications for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
    *   Audit system configurations (SSH, firewall, TLS) against security benchmarks.
    *   Review authentication and authorization implementations.
*   **Workflow Integration:**
    1.  Integrate automated scans (Trivy, linters) into CI/CD pipelines.
    2.  Schedule regular network and vulnerability scans (e.g., weekly/monthly using OpenVAS).
    3.  Perform manual audits and penetration testing exercises periodically, especially after major changes.
    4.  Treat security findings like bugs: prioritize, track, and remediate them.
*   **Example Test Cases:**
    *   **Network Scan:** Run `nmap -sV <homelab_subnet>` to identify all open ports and running services. Verify only expected ports/services are exposed.
    *   **Container Scan:** Use `Trivy image <image_name>` in CI to check for vulnerabilities before deployment. Fail the build if critical vulnerabilities are found.
    *   **TLS Configuration Check:** Use `testssl.sh <service_domain_name>` to check for weak protocols/ciphers, certificate issues, and security headers (HSTS, CSP).
    *   **Web App Scan:** Run OWASP ZAP baseline scan against web applications exposed via the reverse proxy.
    *   **SSH Audit:** Use `ssh_scan` or manually check `sshd_config` against hardening guidelines (key auth only, no root login, strong ciphers/MACs).
*   **Interpreting Results:**
    *   **Vulnerability Reports:** Prioritize findings based on severity (e.g., CVSS score). Investigate and apply patches or configuration changes. False positives may occur; verify findings.
    *   **Open Ports:** Unexpected open ports indicate firewall misconfigurations or unauthorized services. Investigate and close them.
    *   **Configuration Weaknesses:** Harden configurations based on audit results (e.g., disable weak TLS versions, enforce stronger SSH settings).
    *   **Web Vulnerabilities:** Address findings like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF by fixing application code or configuring WAF rules.

By implementing this multi-layered testing strategy, the homelab can be developed and maintained with greater confidence in its stability, performance, and security. Remember that testing is an ongoing process, not a one-time task.
