*   **Distributed Tracing Implementation**: Implement trace context propagation across services to enable end-to-end visibility.
*   **Instrumentation Best Practices**: Follow best practices for instrumenting applications to collect relevant telemetry data.
*   **Alerting Rules**: Define clear and actionable alerting rules in Prometheus AlertManager [17].

**Key Limitations:**

*   Integration with an existing **InfluxDB instance on the Home Automation Node** for time-series data [8, 22]. Ensure proper configuration for data export.
*   Consider the performance impact of instrumentation on the monitored applications.
*   Ensure proper configuration of network access between observability components.

## Core Principles

- **Readability:** Write clear, concise, and understandable code
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Extract common logic into reusable components
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prioritize simplicity in design and implementation
- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Avoid unnecessary functionality
- **Composition Over Inheritance:** Build complex objects from smaller components
- **SOLID Principles:** - Single Responsibility (SRP): Each class has one purpose - Open/Closed (OCP): Open for extension, closed for modification - Liskov Substitution (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for base types - Interface Segregation (ISP): Clients shouldn't depend on unused interfaces - Dependency Inversion (DIP): Depend on abstractions, not implementations

---

## Code Style & Documentation

- **Naming:** Use descriptive names for all code elements
- **Formatting:** Follow language-specific style guidelines (e.g., PEP8 for Python)
- **Interface-First Design:** Define clear contracts between components
- **Dependency Injection:** Use constructor injection by default
- **Abstractions:** Create interfaces for all major components
- **Documentation:**
  - Document interface contracts clearly
  - Specify dependencies in docstrings
  - Mandatory docstrings for modules, classes, and functions
  - Use Google-style docstrings with Args, Returns, Raises sections
  - Write docstrings that can be extracted by documentation tools (mkdocs, sphinx)
  - Include examples in docstrings for complex functions
  - Document Pydantic fields with clear descriptions for auto-generated API docs
  - Comments explaining the "why" behind code decisions
  - Meaningful type hints without redundancy
  - Ensure consistency in documentation style
- **Encapsulation:**
  - Protect internal state with appropriate access modifiers
  - Use private/protected attributes and methods where applicable
  - Hide implementation details behind interfaces

---

## API Documentation

- Add OpenAPI decorators and metadata to all API endpoints
- Include comprehensive summaries and descriptions for endpoints
- Document response models, status codes, and error responses
- Provide example requests and responses where helpful
- Document authentication and authorization requirements
- Use type annotations that generate clear API schemas
- Organize endpoints with logical tags and grouping
- Ensure Pydantic model field descriptions propagate to API docs

---

## Function & Method Design

- Keep functions small with a single responsibility
- Minimize side effects and aim for pure functions
- Use meaningful, limited parameters
- Maintain consistent return types
- Apply Command-Query Separation (CQS)

---

## Commit Message Format
- 📝 Be extremely detailed with file changes
- 🤔 Explain the reasoning behind each change
- 🎨 Use relevant emojis to categorize changes
- Examples:
  - ✨ feat(auth): Add JWT token validation to login endpoint
  - 🔧 Modified: src/auth/jwt_validator.py
  - 📦 Added: tests/auth/test_jwt_validator.py
  - 🔥 Removed: old token validation logic

## Language-Specific Standards

### Python

- Follow PEP8 with strict typing (mypy compatible)
- Use typing.protocol for interfaces except where abstract base classes are needed
- Use context managers for resource management
- Employ Pydantic for data structures and validation
  - Add field descriptions to all Pydantic model fields
  - Use validators with descriptive error messages
  - Leverage Pydantic's Config for enhanced documentation
- Implement async methods where beneficial
- Follow Domain-Driven Design principles with ports & adapters pattern
- Configure with `pyproject.toml`
- Virtual environment with `uv`: - Create: `uv venv .venv` - Activate (Windows): `.venv\Scripts\activate` - Activate (Unix): `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Manage dependencies with `uv pip`
- FastAPI specific:
  - Use path operation decorators with complete metadata
  - Document response models and status codes
  - Add examples to complex request/response models
  - Organize routes with proper tagging and Router objects

### TypeScript

- Follow ES6+ with strict type annotations
- Implement modular design with appropriate interfaces
- Handle async errors properly
- Test with Jest or Vitest according to project needs
- Ensure compliance with language-specific best practices

---

## Testing

- **Structure:** Follow AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern
- **Naming:** Use verbose class names that clearly state the test case
  Example: `test_UserAuthentication_WithValidCredentials_ReturnsToken`
- **Types:** Write unit, integration, and BDD-style tests
- **Practices:** - Ensure test idempotence - Mock external dependencies - Use descriptive test names following the pattern:
  `test_[Feature]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedResult]` - Use descriptive test names - Integrate tests in CI/CD pipelines - Structure each test with clear AAA sections:

  ````python
  def test_Feature_Scenario_ExpectedResult(): # Arrange # Set up test prerequisites

              # Act
              # Execute the action being tested

              # Assert
              # Verify the expected outcomes
          ```
  ````
