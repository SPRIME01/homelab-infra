## 1. Vulnerability Scanning & Patching üõ°Ô∏è

**Why?** Software vulnerabilities are constantly discovered. Scanning helps identify them in your OS, containers, and applications, while patching fixes them before they can be exploited.

### üîç Scanning Procedures

*   **Container Images:** Use tools like **Trivy** or **Clair** to scan container images for known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). Integrate this into CI/CD pipelines if possible.
    *   **Schedule:** Weekly (automated) or before deploying new/updated images.
    *   **Automation Example (Trivy):**
        ```bash
        # Scan a specific image
        trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL my-registry/my-app:latest

        # Scan all running images in the cluster (requires Trivy operator or similar setup)
        # Or script iterating through `kubectl get pods -A -o jsonpath='{.items[*].spec.containers[*].image}'`
        ```
*   **Operating System:** Regularly check for available OS package updates.
    *   **Schedule:** Weekly (automated check).
    *   **Automation Example (Debian/Ubuntu):**
        ```bash
        # Run on each node via SSH or Ansible
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt list --upgradable
        # Consider tools like `apticron` for notifications
        ```
*   **Kubernetes Components:** Check for vulnerabilities in Kubernetes components themselves (API Server, etcd, kubelet, etc.). Often tied to Kubernetes version updates.
*   **Application Dependencies:** Use language-specific tools (`npm audit`, `pip check`, `mvn dependency-check`) to scan application code dependencies. Integrate into development/CI pipelines.

### ü©π Patching Procedures

*   **Prioritization:** Focus on critical and high-severity vulnerabilities first, especially those with known exploits.
*   **Testing:** **ALWAYS** test patches in a staging/development environment if possible before applying to your main homelab services, especially for critical components like Kubernetes or databases.
*   **OS Patching:**
    *   Use the `system-update.py` script (or Ansible) for coordinated OS package updates across nodes.
    *   **Schedule:** Apply security patches weekly/bi-weekly after review. Apply critical patches ASAP.
*   **Kubernetes Patching:**
    *   Follow the official Kubernetes upgrade procedures (`kubeadm upgrade`). Use the `system-update.py` script for orchestration.
    *   **Schedule:** Apply patch releases (e.g., 1.28.x -> 1.28.y) monthly/quarterly after testing. Plan minor version upgrades (e.g., 1.28 -> 1.29) carefully.
*   **Container Image Patching:**
    *   Rebuild application images using updated base images containing OS patches.
    *   Update application dependencies and rebuild images.
    *   Use the `system-update.py` script (or GitOps tools like Argo CD Image Updater / Flux) to roll out updated images.
    *   **Schedule:** Weekly/Bi-weekly for base images, driven by vulnerability scans for dependencies.
*   **Patching Workflow:**

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Scan for Vulnerabilities] --> B{Prioritize Patches};
        B -- Critical/High --> C{Test Patch (Staging)};
        B -- Medium/Low --> D[Schedule Patch];
        C -- Test OK --> E[Apply Patch (Production)];
        C -- Test Failed --> F[Investigate/Fix/Defer];
        D --> C;
        E --> G[Verify Fix];
        F --> A;
        G --> A;
    ```

## 2. Security Configuration Reviews ‚öôÔ∏è

**Why?** Default configurations aren't always secure. Regularly reviewing settings ensures they align with security best practices and haven't drifted over time.

### üìã Review Areas & Tools

*   **Kubernetes Cluster:**
    *   **RBAC:** Review Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoleBindings. Ensure least privilege. (`kubectl get rolebindings,clusterrolebindings -A -o wide`)
    *   **Network Policies:** Verify policies correctly restrict traffic between pods/namespaces. (`kubectl get networkpolicies -A`)
    *   **Pod Security Admission/Policies:** Ensure appropriate security contexts and restrictions are applied.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Check how secrets are stored and accessed (e.g., using Sealed Secrets, Vault, native Secrets).
    *   **Tools:** Use **kube-bench** to check against CIS Benchmarks, **kubescape** for broader security posture scanning.
    *   **Schedule:** Quarterly or after significant cluster changes.
*   **Operating System (Nodes):**
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Check `iptables`, `nftables`, or `ufw` rules. Ensure only necessary ports are open.
    *   **SSH Configuration:** Review `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Disable root login, enforce key-based auth, use strong ciphers/MACs.
    *   **User Accounts:** Audit local user accounts and sudo privileges.
    *   **Schedule:** Bi-Annually or after node provisioning/changes.
*   **Applications:**
    *   Review application-specific security settings (authentication methods, API rate limiting, input validation).
    *   Check how applications handle secrets.
    *   **Schedule:** Annually or during application updates.

## 3. Credential & Access Management üîë

**Why?** Compromised credentials are a primary attack vector. Regular rotation and access audits limit the window of opportunity for attackers and enforce the principle of least privilege.

### üîÑ Credential Rotation

*   **Passwords:** Rotate passwords for user accounts (OS, Grafana, etc.) and service accounts where applicable. Use strong, unique passwords (consider a password manager).
    *   **Schedule:** Every 90-180 days.
*   **API Keys/Tokens:** Rotate API keys for services (cloud providers, external APIs, internal service tokens like InfluxDB tokens).
    *   **Schedule:** Every 60-90 days or based on provider recommendations.
*   **SSH Keys:** Consider rotating SSH keys periodically, especially if exposure is suspected. Ensure old keys are removed from `authorized_keys` files.
    *   **Schedule:** Annually or as needed.
*   **Certificates:** Monitor expiration dates for TLS certificates (Ingress, internal CAs, etcd, Kubernetes components).
    *   **Kubernetes:** Use `sudo kubeadm certs check-expiration` on control plane nodes. Renew using `kubeadm certs renew`.
    *   **Ingress:** Use `cert-manager` for automated renewal from Let's Encrypt or other CAs.
    *   **Schedule:** Monitor monthly, renew well before expiration (e.g., 30 days prior).

### üßê Access Control Audits

*   **User Accounts:** Review all active user accounts across systems (OS nodes, Kubernetes RBAC, Grafana, databases, etc.). Disable or remove unused accounts.
*   **Group Memberships:** Check memberships in privileged groups (e.g., `sudo`, `docker`, K8s `cluster-admin`).
*   **Kubernetes RBAC:** Audit RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings. Verify permissions granted are necessary for the associated user/service account.
    *   `kubectl get rolebindings,clusterrolebindings -A -o wide`
    *   Tools like `rakkess` or `kubectl-who-can` can help visualize permissions.
*   **SSH Access:** Review `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` files on all nodes. Remove keys for users/systems that no longer require access.
*   **API Token Usage:** If possible, audit the usage logs of API tokens to ensure they are only used by expected clients/services.
*   **Schedule:** Quarterly.

*   **Audit Workflow:**

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[List Accounts/Roles/Keys] --> B{Review Necessity};
        B -- Needed --> C{Verify Permissions};
        B -- Not Needed --> D[Disable/Remove Account/Key];
        C -- Permissions OK --> E[Document Review];
        C -- Over-Privileged --> F[Reduce Permissions (Least Privilege)];
        F --> E;
        D --> E;
        E --> A; # Continuous cycle
    ```

## 4. Security Monitoring & Logging üïµÔ∏è

**Why?** You can't protect against what you can't see. Monitoring and logging help detect suspicious activities, failed logins, policy violations, and active attacks in near real-time.

### üìä Monitoring & Alerting

*   **Prometheus Alerts:** Review and tune alert rules defined in `homelab-observability/prometheus/rules/alerting-rules.yml`. Ensure alerts cover:
    *   Node resource exhaustion (CPU, Mem, Disk).
    *   Node down/unresponsive.
    *   Kubernetes component health (API server, etcd).
    *   Pod crashes/restarts, pending pods.
    *   Certificate expiration (`cert-manager` metrics).
    *   Security-specific metrics (e.g., failed logins if exposed via an exporter).
*   **Runtime Security:** Consider tools like **Falco** to detect suspicious behavior *inside* containers and on nodes based on system calls. Define and tune Falco rules.
*   **Schedule:** Review alert configuration quarterly. Respond to triggered alerts promptly!

### üìú Logging

*   **Centralized Logging:** Ensure logs from nodes (syslog, journald), Kubernetes components (via cluster logging agent like Fluentd/Loki), and applications are collected centrally (e.g., Loki, Elasticsearch).
*   **Kubernetes Audit Logs:** Enable and collect Kubernetes audit logs. These provide a detailed record of requests to the API server (who did what, when). Configure an appropriate audit policy.
*   **Log Review:** Regularly review key logs for anomalies:
    *   Authentication logs (`/var/log/auth.log`, application login events).
    *   Firewall logs (denied connections).
    *   Kubernetes audit logs (unauthorized requests, excessive permissions usage).
    *   Ingress controller logs (suspicious request patterns, 4xx/5xx errors).
*   **Schedule:** Review key security logs weekly. Perform deeper dives monthly or during incident investigation.

## 5. Staying Informed üì∞

**Why?** The threat landscape is constantly evolving. Staying informed about new vulnerabilities, attack techniques, and security best practices is crucial.

### üìö Information Sources

*   **CVE Databases:**
    *   [MITRE CVE List](https://cve.mitre.org/)
    *   [NVD (National Vulnerability Database)](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
*   **Vendor Security Advisories:**
    *   Kubernetes: [Security Announcements Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce), [Security Advisories on GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Asecurity)
    *   OS Distribution (e.g., Ubuntu Security Notices, Debian Security Advisories).
    *   Key Software Vendors (e.g., Nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis, application frameworks).
*   **Security News & Blogs:** Follow reputable security news sites (e.g., The Hacker News, Bleeping Computer) and blogs from security researchers or companies.
*   **Homelab Communities:** Forums and communities often discuss security issues relevant to homelab setups.

### ‚ö° Taking Action

*   When a relevant vulnerability or advisory is published:
    1.  **Assess Applicability:** Does it affect software versions you are running?
    2.  **Assess Risk:** How severe is it? Is there a known exploit? What is the potential impact on your homelab?
    3.  **Plan Mitigation/Patching:** Prioritize based on risk. Apply patches following the procedures above. Implement workarounds if patches aren't available yet.
*   **Schedule:** Dedicate time weekly (e.g., 30 minutes) to review key sources.
